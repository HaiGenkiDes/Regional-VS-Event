# Region-VS-Region Game Mode

## Motivation
VS Events so far have been unsatisfying in many regards.  The biggest drawback is that only two champions participate.  In blind pick up to 4 players can play the vs champions and only 2 players in draft (assuming they aren't banned).  Let's be real, "Win a game with garen on your team" is a pretty unsatisfying mission, especially if you play a role where garen is not a viable champion.  In addition, someone else usually plays the champ anyways so if you play regularly completing the mission doesn't actually require any extra effort.  

## Overview

Region-VS-Region will pit region vs region allowing all players in the game to take a central role in the VS event. 
- Players on each team vote on a region to fight for. If no region has 3/5 votes, region will be selected randomly from the regions with votes. 
- Champion selection will be limited to only champions from the selected region
- Each side of the summoners rift map will take on characteristics of the region of the team that is defending it.  
- Turrets, minions and jungle monsters will be unique to each region.
- Each region will have a unique neutral epic monster. These will replace Baron and Dragon
- 


## Implementation
Overhauling SR with many possible regions that affect the look of turrets, minions, jungle and epic monsters is a gigantic task, which is why Regional-Vs-Events make a lot of sense for setting the groundwork for a new game mode.  A Regional-VS-Event would be similar to a Region-VS-Region game mode, but it would have only two choices for Regions. A series of Regional-Vs-Events will allow the developers to focus on two regions at a time.  Below is an example schedule:
- Month 1 Ionia North (Placidium) vs Noxus
- Month 2 Piltover vs Zaun (release Piltover tank)
- Month 3 Shadow Isles vs Bilgewater
- Month 4 Ionia South (Bandle City) vs Void (release tanky bandle city jungler)
- Month 5 Freljord vs Demacia
- Month 6 Shurima Vs Targon (release Targon ADC champion)

At the conlcusion of the Regional-VS-Events, Region-VS-Region game mode will be unlocked. ]
